The psychological impact in some cases is so severe that it leads to suicidal attempts by the victims.
                Growing Internet and Porn addiction among children is another cause of great concern that is having a very negative impact on their young mind. Children today spend hours on social networking sites which proves to be really unhealthy considering their tender age. It could result in various kinds of physical problems along with the grave danger of developing of mental anxiety. </p>
